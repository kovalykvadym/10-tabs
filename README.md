## 📌 About the Project

This project demonstrates how to build a **tabbed interface** — a common UI pattern that allows users to switch between different sections of content without leaving the page.

Tabbed content UI is widely used to organize information on web pages in a compact and user-friendly way, improving UX and navigation.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a working **tabs component** from scratch.
- Practice DOM manipulation with **vanilla JavaScript**.
- Style UI elements using modern **CSS techniques**.
- Understand how to show/hide content dynamically.
- Make the component accessible and responsive.

---

## ✅ Features Implemented

- **Interactive Tabs** — clicking a tab shows its content.
- **Active State Styling** — the currently selected tab is visually highlighted.
- **Clean UI Layout** — minimal design for clarity.
- **Responsive Layout** — works well on desktop and small screens.
- **Modular JavaScript** — logic separated in an external script.

## 🧠 How It Works (Basic Logic)

1. Each tab button has a data attribute linking it to a content panel.
2. When a tab is clicked:
   - Remove the active class from all tabs and panels.
   - Add the active class to the clicked tab and its related panel.
3. This shows the relevant content while hiding others.
